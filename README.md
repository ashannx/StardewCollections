# StardewCollections1.0
Ever get annoyed at constantly opening the menu while trying to finish the Stardew Valley Collections? Keep this program open on a second monitor and keep track of your progress.  When you are done for the day, hit the save button to save your progress to the csv.  

## Implementation
